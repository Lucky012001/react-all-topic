ReactJS ek open-source JavaScript library hai, jo user interfaces (UI) banane ke liye use hoti hai. Ye library, Facebook ke dwara develop kiya gaya tha aur ab React community dvara maintain kiya ja raha hai. React, ek component-based approach par kaam karta hai jisme har component ke liye alag se code likha jata hai aur phir usko combine kiya jata hai ek final UI ke liye.

React ki ek khaas baat hai ki isme virtual DOM (Document Object Model) ka use kiya jata hai. Virtual DOM ka use karke, React application ko efficient aur fast banaya ja sakta hai kyunki isme only modified components ko update kiya jata hai, aur poore DOM ko update karne ki zaroorat nahi hoti.

React ka use single-page applications (SPA), web applications, mobile applications, aur desktop applications me kiya jata hai. Iske sath-sath, React ke saath Redux jaise state management libraries ka use kiya jata hai, jisse application ke state ko efficiently manage kiya ja sakta hai.

React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs). It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers. React uses a component-based approach, where each component is written separately and then combined to form a final UI.

One of the key features of React is the use of a virtual DOM (Document Object Model). By using a virtual DOM, React can make applications more efficient and faster because it only updates modified components rather than the entire DOM.

React can be used to build single-page applications (SPAs), web applications, mobile applications, and desktop applications. In addition, React is often used in conjunction with state management libraries such as Redux to efficiently manage an application's state.
