The useMemo hook is a built-in React hook that memoizes the result of a function call and returns the memoized value. It takes two arguments: a function that returns a value, and an array of dependencies that determine when the function should be re-executed.

If none of the dependencies have changed since the last render, the hook returns the cached result of the function call. This can improve the performance of your application by avoiding unnecessary re-executions of expensive computations.

The syntax for useMemo is as follows:
 
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
  // compute and return the value
}, [dependency1, dependency2, ...]);
The function passed to useMemo should return the memoized value. The array of dependencies should include all the values that the function depends on. If any of these values change between renders, the function will be re-executed and the memoized value will be updated.

It s important to note that useMemo should only be used when you need to memoize a value based on some dependencies. In general, you should avoid using it unnecessarily, as it can actually slow down your application if used incorrectly.
