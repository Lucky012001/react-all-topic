Prop Drilling is a common problem in React where a parent component passes data down 
to its child component, and the child component further passes it down to its nested 
child components. This process continues at each level of the tree, and can make the 
code complex and difficult to maintain.

An example of Prop Drilling is when a parent component passes a state object down to 
its child component, and the child component passes it down to its nested child 
components. If there is additional data between these nested components, it would also 
need to be passed from the parent component. This requires passing data through props 
at every level of the component hierarchy.

This can make the code complex and difficult to maintain. The solution to Prop Drilling 
is to use state management libraries like Redux or the Context API, which allows us to 
store data in a global state and make it accessible to each component, without passing 
it through props every time. This can make the code simpler and more maintainable.

Prop Drilling, React me ek common problem hai, jisme parent component apne child 
component ko data pass karta hai, aur child component ise apne nested child components 
ke liye further pass karta hai. Yeh process tree ke har level par continue hota hai aur 
isse code complex aur maintainable ban jata hai.

Prop Drilling ka ek example hai jaise ki agar ek parent component ek state object ko 
apne child component tak pass karta hai, aur fir child component ise apne nested child 
components ke liye pass karta hai. Agar in nested components ke beech mein kuch aur 
data bhi hai, to unhein bhi parent component se pass karna padega. Is process mein, 
har component ko props ke madhyam se data ko aage pass karna padta hai.

Isse code kaafi complex ho jata hai aur iske maintenance bhi mushkil ho jata hai. Prop 
Drilling ka samadhan hai ki hum Redux jaise state management library ka upyog karte 
hain ya Context API ka istemaal karte hain, jiske madhyam se hum data ko global state 
ke roop mein store kar sakte hain, aur usko har component ke liye accessible bana sakte 
hain, bina ki unhein har bar props ke madhyam se pass karna pade. Isse code ko simple 
aur maintainable banaya ja sakta hai.
